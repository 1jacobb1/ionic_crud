# ionic_crud
dear elle,

if (using === xampp) {
  // put this to your htdocs
}

though this sample is not yet done, at least i have already started it
the only feature of this sample is only the login and the feeds

Note: i only made a static username and password which: username => jacobb; password => admin123
you can download it


love,
Jacob Brauliozz :*
